You are given initial context in free text format and states space, which is a dict, each key is a latent factor, each value is a list of possible value phrasings for that factor.

Task:
For each latent factor (keep their order), extract all fragments from initial context relevant to (a) the factor as a whole, or (b) any of its possible values. For factors with no relevant info in the context, return an empty string.

**Output:**  
Return a JSON:
```json
{"contexts": [context_for_factor1, context_for_factor2, ...]}
```
â€”list order as in `states_space` keys, each entry a string (possibly empty).

Notes:
- Use only the content from `initial_context` (no inventions or summaries).
- Be as precise/strict as possible; omit irrelevant info.
- Variables:  
  - `states_space` = {states_space}  
  - `initial_context` = {initial_context}
